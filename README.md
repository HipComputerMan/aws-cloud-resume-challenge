Cloud Resume Challenge

The Cloud Resume Challenge is a challenge to host your resume on the cloud. The challenge involves several challenges such as:
*Creating a resume written in HTML and CSS
*Storing the files on a S3 bucket
*Fronting the static website with Cloudfront CDN
*Securing the website by allowing only HTTPS via an ACM certificate and TLS,
*Implementing a visitor counter with DynamoDB, Lambda, and JavaScript
*Creating all of these resources via IaC (Infrastructure as Code)
*Implementing CI/CD Pipelines to automatically update the website
